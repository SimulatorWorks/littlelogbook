Build Instructions
------------------------------------------------------

Qt development packages of Core, Widgets, XML and SQL are needed with minimum version 5.4.
Additionally my atools static library is needed.

- Clone atools GIT repository
- Clone littlelogbook GIT repository into the same directory

Windows
------------------------------------------------------

- Get and install Qt Creator from http://www.qt.io.
- Import atools and littlelogbook into the workspace.
- Configure the projects and enable shadow build for release or debug versions.
-- For atools use the build directory of e.g.: "C:\Projects\atools\release"
-- For littlelogbook use the build directory of e.g.: "C:\Projects\littlelogbook\release"
- Adapt the QT_BIN and GIT_BIN variables in "littlelogbook.pro".
- Run qmake from Qt Creator
- Run lupdate Qt Creator
- Build and run.

It is important that the shadow build directories reside within the project directories and are
named "release" and "debug" depending on desired build. Do not use the default shadow names, this will
break project dependencies.
