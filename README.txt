Little Logbook is a view and extraction program for the FSX logbook. It allows fast and intuitive
search and grouping of logbook entries based on several parameters, as well as export to
HTML, CSV and Google Earth KML documents.
Additional information about airports can be shown together with the MakeRunways Utility by Peter Dowson.

See the Little Logbook help for more information.

Little Logbook supports FSX, FSX Steam Edition and Prepare3d Versions 2 and 3.

An installer or setup program is not available.

Do not extract the archive into the folder "c:\Program Files\" or "c:\Program Files (x86)\" since
you will need administrative privileges in some Windows versions. Since Windows keeps control on
these folders other problems might occur, like replaced or deleted files.
Extract the Zip archive into a folder, like "c:\Own Programs\Little Logbook".
Then start the program by double-clicking "littlelogbook.exe".

Little Logbook is a 32-bit application and was tested with Windows XP 32-bit,
Windows 7 64-bit and Windows 8.1 64-bit.
